I wrote a couple of new technical blog posts for [Socket Supply Co.](https://socketsupply.co/)'s recent [0.5](https://github.com/socketsupply/socket/releases/tag/v0.5.0) release.

- [Frontend Testing with Socket](https://socketsupply.co/blog/frontend-testing-with-socket/)
- [Improved File Resolution](https://socketsupply.co/blog/improved-file-resolution/)

If you read them, let me know what you think!
