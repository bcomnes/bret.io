Birds eye view: I have a variety of experience building software/SAAS infrastructure from the ground up and contributing to large existing codebase and orgs. I generate between 1500 and 3000+ contributions a year, some of which are captured for public scrutiny.

I work primarily in [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript), and now [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) for frontend and backend, but I also really love working in [Go](https://go.dev).

In addition to my professional work, I work on open source tools and products while my kids are napping on the weekend. My latest project is ðŸ¥– [breadcrum.net](https://breadcrum.net) which lets you extract articles and media from around the web so that you can read/listen/watch them in your preferred podcast app and reader device. It's free right now too! You should check it out.

I enjoy working within the GitHub open source model, and have publisher status on over [300 npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/~bret), some of which I even originated. There is a decent chance I could push code changes into your web projects!

One of my most recent package adoptions, [npm-run-all2](https://github.com/bcomnes/npm-run-all2), grew from 1000 to over 11,000 dependents over the last few months. Incredible growth that hasn't slowed down. I am pleased to contribute back a small portion of the work that I benefit from when building with the open source ecosystem.

I will be reaching out to a bunch of you individually, but in the meantime if you are seeing this, please reach out! I would love to reconnect to personally catch up and also chat about ideas for work.
