Google's former and founding motto ["Don't be evil"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_evil) sounds benevolent, but is it?

["Don't be evil"](https://web.archive.org/web/20180421105327/https://abc.xyz/investor/other/google-code-of-conduct.html) paired with the companies premise: lets build products in a way that allows for immeasurable corporate access into people's private lives for fun and profit, unlocking all the positive potential this data can provide.
We'll only use it for good, the Evil™️ things will just be off limits.

Of course the motto changes to "Do the right thing" in 2015 when it's very obvious it's impossible Google to not indulge in the Evil with the potential for it sitting right there.
By loosening up the motto to allow for at least some Evil, so long as its the "right thing", Google can at least be honest with the public that "Evil" is definitely on the table.

Maybe its time to demand "Can't be evil"? Build in a way where the evil just isn't possible.
Reject the possibility of evil in what software you choose to use.
