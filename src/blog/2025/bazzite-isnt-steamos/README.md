I'm thrilled to see Linux becoming a more viable platform for PC gaming, and it's awesome to see so many new Linux users joining the scene.
Unlike commercial operating systems that pay people to clarify and simplify product details, open source exposes users to maximum complexity, clarification, and particularities (IT'S GNU/LINUX!!).
With a new generation of users, it's helpful to know when apples are apples and oranges are oranges.

SteamOS, being a Linux distro, is no different.
There are quite a few things being called "SteamOS" these days in YouTube tutorials, so I figured I could help clear things up.

## Valve's Recovery Image is "SteamOS"

SteamOS has been around for a while‚Äîso much so that there are two distinct versions of it.

- Valve's original Debian-based "SteamOS" that shipped with the [Alienware Steam Machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Machine_(computer)).

</figure>

- The Arch-based ["Steam Deck Recovery image"](https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/1b71-edf2-eb6d-2bb3) that ships Gamescope and Valve's latest 10-foot UI.

  <figcaption>Not very intuitive, but this is the SteamOS you want!</figcaption>
</figure>

The modern Deck Recovery Image isn‚Äôt quite ready for prime time, but it‚Äôs totally usable on a lot of hardware (in the preview 3.7 branch).

**If you aren‚Äôt running one of these, you aren‚Äôt ‚Äúrunning SteamOS‚Äù!**

## SteamOS Derivatives

There have been two known SteamOS derivative distributions: [**HoloISO**](https://github.com/HoloISO/releases) and [**SteamFork**](https://github.com/SteamFork).

A derivative distribution directly takes Valve's SteamOS and other sources as a base and builds from there.
This guarantees they track SteamOS as closely as possible while layering on their own fixes or hardware compatibility support.

**Both HoloISO and SteamFork are now discontinued** (though you can still run them):

- HoloISO was run out of a Russian Telegram channel and had questionable build/distribution practices.
  It was hard to verify that it wasn‚Äôt distributing malware.
  While I don‚Äôt think it ever did, the project wasn‚Äôt transparent or easy to contribute to, and the maintainer was a college student who would disappear regularly.

- SteamFork was a US-based project that was fully open source on GitHub.
  It had a reproducible toolchain, real build infrastructure, and was run much more professionally.
  It produced a very high-quality SteamOS derivative that supported both desktop hardware and a wide variety of handhelds.

In the end, I agree with the SteamFork maintainers: the Chinese handheld vendors should be the ones footing the bill for SteamOS support‚Äînot the community.
The decision to shut down, while disappointing, makes complete sense.
SteamOS 3.7 is basically here‚Äîlet‚Äôs use it.

</figure>

**If you are running a SteamOS derivative, you‚Äôre *nearly* running SteamOS that differs only to the extent the patches change it.**

## Gamescope Distros

The two other notable distros I see frequently labeled as "SteamOS" in the ecosystem are: [ChimeraOS](https://chimeraos.org) and [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg).

**ChimeraOS and Bazzite are not SteamOS.**

They‚Äôre both excellent choices if SteamOS doesn‚Äôt run on your hardware, or if you prefer their broader project goals.
They boot into [**Gamescope**](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/gamescope) and use [Proton](https://www.protondb.com) for game compatibility.

> Gamescope: the micro-compositor formerly known as steamcompmgr

Gamescope is the layer that the Steam 10-foot UI and games run inside on Linux.
It handles resolution scaling, performance overlays, FSR upscaling, and other key features made popular by the Steam Deck.

**We‚Äôll call non-SteamOS-derivative distros that boot into Gamescope ‚ÄúGamescope distros.‚Äù**

### ChimeraOS

  <figcaption>ChimeraOS: the best logo of them all.</figcaption>
</figure>

Chimera is a great project that predates modern SteamOS.
It‚Äôs an immutable Linux distribution built to provide a console-like experience across many devices.

It‚Äôs Arch-based like SteamOS, but it uses GNOME for desktop mode instead of KDE.
It also runs its own update schedule, separate from Valve or the broader SteamOS ecosystem.
It ships its own 10-foot UI, emulation support, and web-based management tools.

If SteamOS 3.7 or SteamFork doesn‚Äôt work for your device‚Äîor if you prefer Chimera‚Äôs vision and community‚Äîthis is a solid choice.

### Bazzite

  <a href="https://bazzite.gg">
    <img loading="auto"
         src="./img/bazzite.webp"
         alt="Screenshot of Bazzite's website">
  </a>
  <figcaption>Bazzite has the most "enthusiastic" community, in my experience.</figcaption>
</figure>

I haven‚Äôt used Bazzite personally, but like Chimera, it‚Äôs not a SteamOS derivative.
It boots into Gamescope and feels a lot like SteamOS.

Bazzite is based on Fedora and makes heavy use of process containers, which makes it even more distinct from SteamOS.

It‚Äôs very popular on Reddit, has strong community support, and offers good hardware compatibility.
However, because it‚Äôs Fedora-based, you‚Äôll encounter many differences when tinkering under the hood.
If you like Arch Linux (or want to learn more about it), you may find Fedora-specific quirks frustrating.

**If you're using a Gamescope distro, you are not running SteamOS.**
You‚Äôre running a separate Linux distro with its own lineage that borrows components from SteamOS to work similarly.

## ‚ÄúThis doesn't matter‚Äîthe outcome is the same!‚Äù

Yes and no.
While the direction is similar, details matter in open source.
Different starting points create different outcomes, even if the UX looks the same.
I'm not here to say x is better than y‚Äîjust that x is not y.
Saying you run x when you actually run y is misleading or mistaken.

Welcome to open source!

The point here is to highlight the differences and help you understand when those details might matter.
In many cases, they won‚Äôt.

## ‚ÄúWhich one are you saying I should run?‚Äù

Try them all!
See what works best for your goals and your hardware.
