The steam deck has brought some of the biggest innovations to 10-foot controllers since... well, the first Steam controller.

It's essentially pefrect, except that its not a controller itself, so, for the time being, I've been trying out different controllers to approximate the Deck input. We're really close but there are still some inovations we need in controllers that I hope someone solves over the next few years.

### Steam Deck Controller

- Dual analog resistance sticks (should be hall)
- Capacitive touch sticks
- Xbox style ABXY buttons
- Dual touch pads
- Haptics
- D-Pad
- Quad back paddles
- Analog triggers and shoulder buttons
- Gyro
- Start/Select + Steam and ...
- Can't be used as a controller on anything but itself.

The reason why the deck is the absotely best controller ever made is Gyro, cap sticks and paddles.
This combination provides a compriable fideleity of inpus as mouse and keyboard.
Gyro is the zero friction, precision input used for fine aiming comparible to mouse input.
It takes some practice, but you get greally good with it quickly.
Cap sticks are needed to 'disable' gyro.
The equaivalent action here is a mouse lift.
Since gyro is tied to view angle, you need to reset it sometimes with a stick lift.
Paddles are necessary to (usually) mirror the ABXY buttons to fingers that can operate them without lifting off the sticks.
For one stick lifts now disable gyro, but also you need to keep aiming while operating jump/crouch/reload/etc.
As a bonus, analog sticks are better for driving and provide supirior movement input over WASD.

I can't emphisize this enough: we have the 10-foot input methods to finally match keyboard and mouse.
I can't believe only the switch family of consoles are taking this combo seriosly.

Here are some video essays on specifically Gyro aim if you are still skeptical.

The Steam Deck controller is essentially perfect, except it can't be used as a controller.
So unforuntealy, it's the baseline comparison I have to compare all of the actual controllers against.

The only thing I would change about it is hall effect sticks, and also to allow it to be used as a controller for another Steam Deck/Machine.

### PS5 DaulSense

- Dual Analog Sticks
- Rumble features
- Haptic triggers (though not functional over BLE)
- Touch Pad
- PS Controller Shape Buttons
- D-Pad
- Start Select buttons
- A mic?
- Gyro

### Xbox Series X Controller

### 8BitDo Ultimate

### Hori Steam Pad (Japanese exclusive)

### Steam Controller

You can't buy these new anymore.
I have one from when they came out but hardly ever got to use it (I wanted to!)
The influence it had on the Steam Deck input is clear, but its limitations jump out as well.

Compared to the Deck controller, the Steam controller has:

- Only 2 back paddles
- Only a single analog stick
- Oversized touch pads
- No D-Pad
- The worse triggers/shoulders of any controller.
- Great Gyro aim
- 2.4Ghz and BLE connectivity
- Haptics so good it can play music

For games that are still mouse heavy, the Steam controller has a slight advantage.
