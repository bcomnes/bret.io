I came across Mr. Oizo in the early 2000s, if I recally correctly. Flat Beat is a banger, and I kept coming back for more of his music. Maybe I'll write up my favorites someday.

Fast forward to 2022/2023, I rediscovered Mr. Oize as Quentin Dupieux making a ton of incredible movies. Here are my favorite Quentin Dupieux Movies and some thoughts on them.
The movies take a sort of self aware Wes Anderson film feel without much pretention.
Most of them are silly, entertaining and just generally well executed, both technically and in the writing and acting, all executed on an impressively small budged.
Nothing goes to waste in these movies, and its incredibly refreshing.

## 1. Mandibles

I think of all of his movies, Mandibles is my favorite.
It's about two lowlife criminals who steal a car, find a gigantic fly in the trunk, and then get mistaken as old grow up high school sweethearts and get invited to a vacation home.
It's silly, energetic and, I'm not sure why, but reminded me of my youth.
It captures his style of film making, isn't too bizzarre, but is still funny and surreal.
Highly recommended!

## 2. Yannick

Yannick is about a young construction worker who attends a play.
The play is boring, so he stands up and interrupts the performance to tell them they should make it better, and provides some earnist and honestly good ideas.
The whole theater thinks he's insane, and treat him that way.
Having travled a long way to attend the play, only to be let down and disrepected, our protagonist hihacks the theater with a pistol, demands a typewriter and printer and sets out to rewrite the play.
It has an incredible ending chrechendo, with touching and emotional high.

## 3. Smoking Causes Coughing

This movie is about a Power Ranger inspired monster fighting team, except their super powers are the deadly chemicals from smoking somehow.
The movie is kind of a flex in film making, pulling out and executing all of the classic special effects, costumes, and gore.
We kind of take all of these movie making techniques for grantid now, so for a movie to almost explicitly exist to perform these tricks in a well executed manner is just simply entertaining to see.
Outside of the general technical film making techniques, the story follows a series of bizarre and funny and just generally entertaining stories

## 4. Keep an Eye Out!

This movie follows a suspect and a cop who is interviewing him.
He is clearly innocent, but the evidence, and circumstances keep stacking up against him.
It almost feels like a bad dream you can't wake up from.

## 5. Incredible but True

This is a funny movie about a couple who buys a house that has a tunnel in the basement.
If you go down the tunnel, you end up climbing down a ladder in the attic, sort of like a Portal.
The real estate agent shares something interesting about this portal though: every time you go through it, you come out 6 days youngler, but 2 weeks passes to those outside of the portal.
The wife, who is getting a bit older in the movie, immediately gets addicted to the tunnel, seeking to return to her younger physique.
Meanwhile, her husband gets 2 weeks older every time she goes through, and ends up aging considerably in the movie as she finally returns to a few years younger.
The ending is shocking and there are a slew of funny side stories, like the husbands obnoxious boss who flies to japan to get a "smart penis" augmentation installed that he can control with an iPhone app.
Between the cyberpunk subplots, and the exploration of temptation and self image, this is a great movie!

## 6. Wrong Cops / Wrong

I saw these when they came out and I still really like them.
They are surreal and don't make much sense, but they are entertaining and the characters are obnoxious and entertaining to see develop on screen.
Wrong Cops is the bettwer of the two.
Wrong, like Rubber, still has a lot of "No reason" all over it, which I don't enjoy as much, but the story about the psychic dog is still really entertaining, and all the locatiins they shoot on are interesting enough on their own.
These feature a lot of released Mr. Oizo music in it and it fits perfectly.

## 7. Steak

Steak is very bizarre.
It's really funny.
It mixes this weird american letherman jock aesthetic with compulsive drive for plastic surgery and they're all about drinking milk and eating raw eggs.
The old lifted trucks they drive are really cool too.

## 8. The Second Act

A bunch of funny dialog between a bunch of great french actors.
It is overlaid over a surreal restaurant, run by a waiter who can't pour wine without spilling it.
Simple and satisfying worth a watch

## 9. Daaaaaal√≠!



## 10. Rubber

It's a movie about a killer tire.
Most of the movie is just full of "no reason".
In a lot of ways, it seems like a movie making flex.
There are some funny scenes in it, but overall it's pretty slow but it has a few good songs in it.
