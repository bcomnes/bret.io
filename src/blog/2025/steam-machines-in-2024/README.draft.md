I built a ["Steam Machine"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Machine_(computer)) in 2024.

If you weren't aware, Valve software tried an initiative in 2015 to create Linux based gaming PCs that could be used like a console with a [10-foot user interface](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/10-foot_user_interface).
The idea basically failed initially, but fast forward to 2022 and gaming on Linux is basically on par with Windows PC gaming, and the [Steam Deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Deck) is released.

I had sold my last gaming PC in 2018, vowed to never run a non-unix system ever again, and switched to an Xbox one which I never ended up playing.
When the Deck came out, I jumped on the opportunity to get access to my Steam library again.
The Steam "virtual console" concept finally had it an actual console hardware and form factor to run on and it worked extremely well!
I was able to revisit old games I never finished (Fallout: New Vegas?!) and have all my saves download off Steam cloud and fire right back up like it was 2016 all over again.

After a couple years on the deck, it was clear to me the console form factor for steam was viable. I came across ChimeraOS which provides a dedicated SteamOS distribution for desktop hardware around the same time I stumbled across the Fract Ridge minie ITX case which was about the size of a PS5.

## The Software

I'm running ChimeraOS.
It's a dedicated Linux distribution that defaults into the SteamOS UI, complete with the steam overlay and other fancy features you find on the steam Deck.
It turns your hardware into a console.
It also ships some default support for emulation which I haven't explored much yet, but I presume its similar to how Emudeck works.

## The Hardware

I targeted a budget of $1500 for the core hardware. Final cost came to $1799.71.

Controllers have improved a ton since 2015, and require their own blogpost.
For comeplteness, I will say essentially what you need is:

- A modern Gyro Aim controller
- A couch keyboard mouse combo for situations where you need to type and mouse around.
