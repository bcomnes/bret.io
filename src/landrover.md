# Jaguar Land Rover

At Jaguar Land Rover I worked as a Javascript developer working on various internal infrastructure products and product prototype applications.

## Infotainment Prototypes

I was lead developer on various in-vehicle operating system prototypes targeting the following experiences:

- Rear seat infotainment systems.
- Application IO architecture relating to communication with vehicular CAN buses. 
- Express based (Node.js) servers for coordinating applications running across multiple screens.
- Prototype implementations of JLR's next generation in vehicle operating system.
- Hardware accelerated GUIs using Qt.
- Implementing novel media library experiences and HMIs.
- Facilitate user testing and focus sessions.

## Internal infrastrucutre

The JLR Portland office had recently opened when I joined and I was able to contribute in various ways to their internal infrastructure. 

### SSO

I designed and developed a custom single sign-on service for the on-premise hosted infrastructure using the following technologies:

- Express
- Browserify
- Passport
- Node.js
- Debian
- Google apps

### Documentation server

I developed a custom documentation server that integrated with the SSO service that provided a CI service for building and updating various internal documentation websites that use various static site generators.  Built with: 

- Express
- Browserify
- Nginx
- Jekyll
- Metalsmith
