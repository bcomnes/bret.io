# Zhealth Etch CV Suite

At Zhealth, I helped develop a custom structured documentation app for doctors and physicians in cardiac surgery centers.  The app's claim to fame was its ability reduce a 30 minute documentation session down to 3 minutes, while recording precise observations that wasn't possible by the standard 'by hand' recording methods. 

Etch implemented a custom interactive SVG bodymap engine that allowed for direct input on top of an industry standard cardiac model.
