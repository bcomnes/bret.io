# Deploy To Neocities

`deploy-to-neocities` is a new GitHub action I developed that lets you efficiently deploy files to [Neocities][nc].  It provides you with a continous delivery workflow to Neocities, while editing source material right inside of a Github repo.  As an added benafit, you can utilize the full power and flexibility of the virtual machines that Github Actions provides.  No unfamiliar build environment API to deal with!





As [JAM Stack][jam] increases in popularity (see the success of [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and the major pivot [Vercel]() a.k.a [Zeit]() made from serverless Docker to a beutiful clone of Netlify), I realized that [Neocities][nc] was a also fantastic target for the JAM Stack deployment pattern.
